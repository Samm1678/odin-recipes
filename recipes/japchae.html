        <li>2 small garlic cloves, finely grated</li>
        <li>2 tsp caster sugar</li>
        <li>200g spinach</li>
        <li>¼ tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 small garlic clove, finely grated</li>
        <li>½ tsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>2 tsp toasted sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the noodles following pack instructions, then drain and rinse under cold water. Mix the ingredients for the japchae sauce together and set aside.</li>
        <li>Mix the ingredients for the beef marinade together along with ½ tsp ground black pepper. Tip the beef into the marinade and ensure everything is thoroughly mixed. Set aside for 10 mins to marinate.</li>
        <li>Place the spinach in a large heatproof bowl and cover with boiling water. Wilt for 1 min. Drain the spinach and rinse under cold water. Squeeze out any excess water. Place the drained spinach in a bowl along with the remaining spinach ingredients and ¼ tsp salt and mix. Set to one side.</li>
        <li>Crack the egg into a small bowl and stir with a fork. Place a small frying pan over a medium heat and heat the vegetable oil. Pour in the egg with a pinch of salt and move the pan around to coat it with a thin layer of the egg. Fry for 30 seconds, then flip and cook on the second side for 30 seconds to create a very thin omelette. Remove from the pan to cool, then roll into a tube shape to make it easier to slice. Slice the egg into thin strips, around 0.5cm thick. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large frying pan, heat 1 tbsp vegetable oil over a medium heat. Using a pair of tongs, place the beef in the frying pan and fry for 1-2 mins. Remove the beef and set aside. Wipe the pan clean using kitchen paper and add 1 tsp more oil. Tip in the carrots with a pinch of salt and fry for 2 mins until slightly softened. Remove from the pan, wipe with a paper towel and add another tablespoon of oil. Fry the peppers for 2-3 mins until soft, remove from the pan, wipe clean and add another tablespoon of oil before frying the mushrooms for 6-8 mins until soft and golden.</li>
        <li>Wipe out the pan and keep it on medium heat. Pour in 2 tbsp vegetable oil and when hot tip in the noodles to the pan and toss with a pair of tongs for 2 mins to heat through. Once the noodles are heated through, pour in the japchae sauce and all the other prepared ingredients, including the spring onions. Toss the ingredients together over a high heat for a further 2 mins, making sure everything is well combined and coated with the sauce. Serve immediately with some sesame seeds sprinkled over.</li>
