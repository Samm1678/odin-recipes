    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>175g self-raising flour</li>
        <li>1 tbsp cornflour</li>
        <li>200g vegan fermented (sour) kimchi, drained and finely chopped, and 2 tbsp liquid reserved</li>
        <li>2 tsp gochujang (Korean red pepper paste), or use half sriracha, half miso paste</li>
        <li>2 spring onions, finely sliced</li>
        <li>6 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the flours in a bowl and pour in 200ml ice-cold water and the reserved kimchi liquid. Whisk until a smooth batter is formed.</li>
        <li>Mix in the kimchi, gochujang and spring onions – the batter should be a slightly thick pancake batter, similar to a drop scone consistency. You can add a tablespoon of flour if you need to thicken it a little.</li>
        <li>Place a large, non-stick pan over a high heat with 2 tbsp vegetable oil. Ladle the pancake mix into the pan. Use the back of the ladle to smooth the mixture out to create a thin, even layer. Reduce the heat to medium high. Fry for 2-3 mins, until air bubbles start to pop on the surface and the sides start to crisp.</li>
        <li>Flip the pancake then slightly lift the side of the pancake with a spatula and add another tablespoon of oil underneath – shake the pan a little to make sure the oil coats the bottom of the pancake.</li>
        <li>Use a spatula to press on top of the pancake to ensure the pancake is crispy. Fry for a further 2 mins.</li>
        <li>Flip one last time, pressing down on the pancake again and fry for 30 seconds. Drain on kitchen paper and keep warm in a low oven while you cook the second pancake using the same method. Serve (optionally cut into bite-sized pieces).</li>
    </ol>
